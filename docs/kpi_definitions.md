\# KPI Definitions – Online Retail Analytics



This document defines the core business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

used in the AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard project. These KPIs form the

analytical foundation over which the LLM performs reasoning and explanation.







\## 1. Total Revenue

Definition: Total monetary value of completed transactions.  

Formula:  

Revenue = Quantity × UnitPrice  



Purpose: Measures overall business performance and growth.







\## 2. Monthly Revenue Trend

Definition: Aggregation of total revenue on a monthly basis.  



Purpose: Identifies growth patterns, seasonality, spikes, and declines

in revenue over time.







\## 3. Number of Orders

Definition: Count of unique invoices (InvoiceNo).  



Purpose: Indicates transaction volume and customer purchasing activity.







\## 4. Average Order Value (AOV)

Definition: Average revenue generated per order.  

Formula:  

AOV = Total Revenue / Number of Orders  



Purpose: Helps understand customer spending behavior.







\## 5. Unique Customers

Definition: Count of distinct CustomerID values.  



Purpose: Measures customer base size and engagement.







\## 6. Top Products by Revenue

Definition: Products ranked by total revenue contribution.  



Purpose: Identifies best-selling and most profitable products.







\## 7. Country-wise Revenue Contribution

Purpose: Analyzes geographic performance and market contribution.







\## Why These KPIs Matter

These KPIs are industry-standard metrics used in retail analytics.

In this project, the LLM does not compute these values; instead, it

interprets and explains trends and anomalies observed in these KPIs.
