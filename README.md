# ai-powered-analytics-dashboard
An AI-powered analytics dashboard where an LLM acts as an analytical reasoning layer to convert natural language questions into data-driven insights, trend explanations and automated summaries over business intelligence dashboards.

This project uses the Online Retail II dataset, which contains over one million real-world e‑commerce transactions from a UK-based retailer, making it suitable for realistic sales, customer and trend analysis.
